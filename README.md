# JustPlay

## Introduction

Welcome to the **JustPlay** mobile application repository! This repository contains the source code for a Flutter-based mobile application developed as a technical test. The application aims to meet specific criteria, including a login process, city selection, and a list of games, with the freedom to add additional screens and designs as needed.

## Objective üìù

The objective of this project is to create a mobile application using Flutter. The application should satisfy the following requirements:

- Have at least three screens: login, city selection, and a list of games.
- Incorporate at least one animation or screen transition.
- Additional screens and designs can be implemented as desired.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Install Flutter: Make sure you have Flutter installed on your development machine. You can find installation instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Use FVM with Flutter stable version

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/justplay.git
cd justplay
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Firebase Configuration

This application uses Firebase for various features, including authentication. To set up Firebase in your project, follow these steps:

#### iOS Configuration

1. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory of your project.

#### Android Configuration

1. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory of your project.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Sport Api key

```env
API_KEY=sport_api_key
```

Replace `sport_api_key` with your actual Firebase API key.

### Running the Application

Now that you have set up Flutter and Firebase, you can run the application on your device or simulator:
